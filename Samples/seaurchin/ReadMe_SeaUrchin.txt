Record put together by Rudolf Oldenbourg in August 2024

Light field image of sea urchin egg, fluorescently stained with ??
Image probably recorded on Nikon inverted TiE microscope stand by ?? at Marine Biological Laboratory Woods Hole MA, in February 2022 or earlier.

The egg has a diameter of 400 pixels, with each pixel 7.4µm/20=0.37µm -> 400•0.37µm = 150µm

One µLens diameter is 17•0.37µm = 6.3µm

The following parameters were retrieved from metadata.txt and calibration.py files saved other place for this sea urchin light field image:

Objective lens 20x/0.5NA dry and probably LWD condenser
482/18 excitation , probably 593/40 emission filters
Camera sensor: Retiga 4000R
Microlens array: 125um pitch, 2500um focal length, 1:1 relay lens assembled from two AF Nikkor 50mm 1:1.4 D mounted nose to nose

Software: ImageJ and MicroManager
